Looks like someone found a bug that can read the server's files...<br>
My friend already fix this, is secure now! ðŸ™‚<br>

## Solution

At first glance, I recognized that the challenge revolved around a directory traversal attack. After reviewing the provided hint, I realized that a nested Dot Dot Slash attack was required to retrieve the flag from the site.

Understanding the structure of the source code was crucial, so I navigated to a file named main.py. There, I found a statement explaining the path sanitization process. The code indicated that any ../ found in the site path input would be sanitized and replaced with an empty string ("").

**The source code line.*

To bypass this restriction and exploit the site, we could use `....//` to retrieve the flag from the server. When processed, the site would interpret it as `.. /` and effectively ignore the additional `../`. This approach allowed us to achieve the desired directory traversal and access the flag.
