Feel free to try it.

## Solution

First, I attempted to register a new account and log in to the system.

**Register with the username "aaa" and the password "aaa".*

Then log in using these credentials.

**Login interface.*

Double-click on the website to enter inspect mode. In the inspect mode, you'll find a comment line indicating a PHP site. Replace the site link with the provided PHP link to access the site.
