I remember that I put a flag in this website, but I just can't find it. Can you help me?

## Solution

1. Once entering the site given, we'll see a message that told us there is too bright to find th flag.
2. Hence, right click on the site and enter inspect mode.
3. Change the background colour from white to any dark colour.

   **In this case, I change it to black.*

4. Then we can see the flag is shown.
