I made a website with login using PHP and MySQL! Feel free to try it.<br>

Note: it takes a while to create the database, please refresh until it successfully load the webpage.

## Solution

1. Attempt to enter an email address and password to evaluate the system's input validation.
2. We can simply enter `' OR '1' = '1` as both the email and password to log into the system.
3. Get the flag.
