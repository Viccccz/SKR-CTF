Found a fortune cookie in Kuki Godam's place. The message inside is weird, seems is encrypted. Can you decode it?

## Solution

Open the provided PNG file from the challenge, and you'll notice a cipher encoded in the image. Use any online Caesar Cipher decoder to decipher it. I tested each shift manually until the output matched the flag format "SKR{...}".

**The flag is revealed when using a shift of 13.*
